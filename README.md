# Covid19-Interactive Dashboard and Forecasting
In this mini project I made an [interactive dashboard](https://github.com/deepacefic/Covid19/blob/master/covid_19_Interactive_dashboard.ipynb) for covid19 scenarios across the world. I used [John Hopkings](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data) dataset. Also I have used different time series models and machine learning techniques for forecasting covid19 daily cases in India. Please find my [Abstract](https://github.com/deepacefic/Covid19/blob/master/Abstract.pdf) and [Report](https://github.com/deepacefic/Covid19/blob/master/Report.pdf) for detailed insights.
